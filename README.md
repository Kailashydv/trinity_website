# How to contribute?
To contribute just download this repository. [Click here to download](https://codeload.github.com/tcc-collab/trinity_website/zip/master). A zip file will be downloaded now unzip it.

Go to the frontend folder and open index.html file in browser.
This is frontend of the website.
Now open this index.html in text editor and edit it and make improvements and changes.
The css file is inside the css folder of frontend folder. Only edit main.css.

Similarly the html of index.html has been divided to following parts:
- body.html
- navigation.html
- footer.html

These files are also in same folder as index.html. You can also view them in browser or edit them and make changes. Now after making improvement or changes. Open the file in text editor and copy all them code and email me at:
 sharmahemanta.212@gmail.com

Also email me the css file.


# If you know github.
If you know how to use github. You don't need to email me :). Just fork the repo, make changes and submit me a Pull Request.


# WHAT TO FIX?
Well when you see index.html you can see 4 components.
- Navigation
- Notice section/News section
- Event section
- Footer part

You can propose changes for these parts. You can improvise on my html/css or if you don't like it you can create your own design from beginning and sent me. I will be happy to replace.


## THE DIFFICULT PARTS
The news_notice folder in same frontend folder is the most challenging part so far.

If you go to current site [HERE](https://trinitycollege.herokuapp.com) and click on any one of link in notice and news parts the it opens that notice/news. The 'news_notice' folder contains the html for these pages.

The two files:
- notice_easy.html
- news_easy.html
Open these files in browser. The problem is obvious, (NOTICE banner, date) are not good.

*NOTE* You MUST NOT modify the html file but you can just link the css file there and fix the design in separate css file. (contact me to ask the reason)
When you are done send me the css.


If you don't like it and modify these from clean start then
you have to design (add css) for the divs in  following files:
- notice_raw.html
- news_raw.html
These raw doesnot have ANY styling just plain html.

THE PROBLEM is that you cannot change any html. You have to add css for existing html. Open the files in browser, read the tags and their classes and style them in separate css file. You can link the css file in html however. When you are done making it pretty send me the css file.
